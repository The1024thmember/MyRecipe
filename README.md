# MyRecipe

A website that allows user to register, login, logout, manage his/her own profile, post edit delete recipe which contains title, ingredient, method to cook and an image. A user could also follow or unfollow other user such that, in his dashboard he would be able to see recipe post by the people he follows. The user would also be able to like or comment on any recipe, when glance a certain recipe's detail information, the system will recommend similar types of ingredient based on the current recipe he/she focused at.


The code is originated from "COMP3900-9900-Capstone-Project/capstoneproject-comp9900-w18a-muggles" which is a private github repo as this project is school assignment, I copied the frontend code from this project that I am working on(In the page folder, the profilePage.js, UpdaterecipePage.js and userGallery.js as well as the components are independently developed by myself). As you can see the style of the the components and the pages have been separated from the js code.
